# luganda-voices
Simple repository for my Internship with College of Computing, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.


With this, I'm trying to come up with a number of Luganda voice recordings with their respective text. I dedicated this to my Internship Supervisor, Dr. Peter Nabende, Head of Information Systems Department, College of Computing and Information Science, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.
